About 3 months ago, I made a blog post announcing my potential departure. Among other things, I said that'd I'd provide an update at around this time.

Short update is that it's been better than I thought so I'm still able to persist with an online presence, so I won't be going offline, but I will definitely be off more often than before.

As a side note, I am working on 3 pages about ideas I have. Mostly because if I ever stop coding I kind of want to at least put my ideas out there. Stay tuned for those... if I ever finish them.

Thanks for your support (if you gave me any)!

Also, I originally planned this to go up last month as of writing this but due to complications in upgrading to Astro's new Content Collections API, I had to delay until now. It was.. an interesting proces, to say the least. At least I took the time to also add some new stuff to the site as well ðŸ¤·
