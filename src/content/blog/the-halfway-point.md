About 3 months ago, I made a blog post announcing my potential departure. Among other things, I said that'd I'd provide an update at around this time.

As a short update, it's been better than I thoguht so I'm still able to persist with an online presence, so I won't be going offline, but I will definitely be off more often than before.

As a side note, I am working on 3 blog posts about ideas I have. Stay tuned for those... if I ever finish them.

Thanks for your support!
