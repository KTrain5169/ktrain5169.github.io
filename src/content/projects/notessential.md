This website is a site dedicated to informing visitors why the Essential mod is bad.

The Essential mod is a mod designed to be "the only mod you'll need for Minecraft", which is... completely untrue because you still need other mods to fill the gap. For example, Essential doesn't provide optimizations to the game.

There are other reasons why Essential is not that great, so I recommend you check out the website.
