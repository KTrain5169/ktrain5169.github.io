Have you ever thought "I want to translate my sentence to something wacky?" No? Too late, we made a script for that.

The script is able to manipulate your (English) characters, adding some wackiness or flair to your sentences!

For more information and supported translation options, go to the GitHub page and look at the FEATURES.md file. You can also try a web version of Translator maintained by WorldWidePixel, named [Ward](https://ward.worldwidepixel.ca/).
