Advanced CatPacks are CatPacks for Prism Launcher designed to be more dynamic than just one image. This application makes it easier for you to do this, by tossing them all into a folder for you, and creating the necessary JSON file to make it works.

This supports both Prism 8.4 and 9.0 CatPack JSON formats.

For all documentation on the program please visit the documentation site.
