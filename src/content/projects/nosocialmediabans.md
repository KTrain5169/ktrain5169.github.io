The Australian Government is planning to enforce a blanket ban to social media for under-16s, with zero details and them not asking the people who gets impacted by this the most.

To counteract this, I've made a website explaining why this is an extremely poorly thought-out idea meant to satisfy lazy parents and actually puts some Australian kids at more risk than if this was never drafted.

Please spread awareness of this, as it's very important and affects many people's lives!
