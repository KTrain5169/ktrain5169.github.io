Have you ever needed to get your hands on a Modrinth modpack, but you are using the default launcher? Or maybe the launcher you have right now doesn't support Modrinth modpacks (a small minority at this point).

Whatever the case may be, `unpacker` will help you by downloading all the resources inside the modpack for you, and then putting them all into a folder. Then, you can just drag the folder contents inside your instance's/installation's `.minecraft` folder, and you are good to go!
